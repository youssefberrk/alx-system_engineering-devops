**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** Our web application took an unexpected siesta on April 12, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM (GMT-5).
- **Impact:** 60% of our users had to twiddle their thumbs while the remaining 40% experienced a slow-motion rendition of our service.
- **Root Cause:** Picture this: an avalanche of write requests buried our database, leaving it gasping for air and our service on pause.

**Timeline:**
- **9:45 AM:** Monitoring system screamed louder than a banshee, alerting us to the chaos.
- **9:50 AM:** Engineering team rushed in like knights in shining armor, ready to slay the digital dragon.
- **10:15 AM:** We suspected the load balancer was playing hide-and-seek, but alas, it was innocent.
- **11:00 AM:** Database team unearthed the real culpritâ€”our overwhelmed database cluster.
- **12:00 PM:** We threw a lifeline by beefing up the database cluster, but the service still played hard to get.
- **2:00 PM:** After a dramatic showdown with the database demons, we emerged victorious, and service was restored!

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- **Cause:** An unexpected write request tsunami swamped our database, sending it into a tailspin.
- **Resolution:** We flexed our database muscles by beefing up the cluster and optimizing its performance, restoring order to the digital realm.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Improvements:** We're adding more eyes and ears to our monitoring system, fine-tuning our database configuration, and drafting battle plans for future skirmishes.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Summon the monitoring wizards to conjure up new alerts for database activity.
  2. Dive deep into the database dungeons, seeking hidden treasures of performance optimization.
  3. Forge a playbook for scaling database resources during peak demand, complete with epic illustrations.
  4. Embark on a quest for knowledge through regular load testing adventures.
  5. Gather the fellowship for a post-incident debrief, sharing tales of valor and lessons learned.

Remember, even in the darkest of digital dungeons, there's always a light at the end of the server rack. Stay brave, stay vigilant, and may your code be ever bug-free!
